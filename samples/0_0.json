The video is about a comprehensive guidance to perform a specific task. \n\nThe full task guideline is as follows:\nWelcome back to our AIE tutorial series to help you get to know your Honda GX160. Today we're going to be checking and changing the oil on our Honda GX160 UT2 QX2 with genuine Honda engine oil using 08207-10W30. Please check the oil before every use. You'll want to change the oil after the first month or 20 hours of use and after that every six months or 100 hours. Before changing your oil make sure the engine is fully cooled down and you have your 10mm 6-point socket and ratchet handy as well as an oil pan. First let's locate the gray oil filter gauge cap assembly. The location of the cap will vary based on the application of the engine. Unscrew the oil filter gauge cap assembly. Pull out the cap and wipe it cleanly. To check the oil level dip the cap back in. Do not thread the cap in any further. This will give you an accurate indication of current oil levels. The specification for the oil quantity is 0.61 quarts which should amount to about three quarters of the way up on the oil filter gauge. Now locate the oil drain plug located at the base of the block. The location may vary depending on the application of the engine. Take your ratchet and loosen the oil drain plug. Once the plug is loosened fully unscrew it by hand. Make sure that you have an oil pan to collect the used oil. Reinsert the drain plug washer and tighten it by hand. Then fully secure the plug by tightening with your ratchet to 13 foot-pounds of torque. Do not over tighten otherwise you will crack the block. Begin filling the engine with 19.5 fluid ounces or 577 milliliters of genuine Honda oil. Always check the oil one last time after refill to ensure the correct amount.

Can you reason step by step to predict what is the next step to compete in this task?\n"

      "value": "The sequence of images you have provided appear to be from an instructional video or a tutorial related to a Honda GX160 engine. Unfortunately, the images speak more to the branding of the tutorial series rather than the actual steps involved in performing the task described. The initial images show the logo and tagline of the company presumably producing the video. The subsequent images highlight the engine model - Honda GX160 UT2 QX2, and then show the specified oil - Honda 10W-30 engine oil with part number 08207-10W30.\n\nBased on the task guideline you've provided for checking and changing the oil in the Honda GX160, and assuming these images show the last steps that were completed, here is a prediction of what would come next in the task, step by step:\n\n1. **Locating the Gray Oil Filter Gauge Cap Assembly**: Assuming the video has identified the engine and shown the appropriate oil, the next step would typically be to locate the gray oil filter gauge cap assembly on the actual engine, which might be shown in the video, but this image is missing from the sequence you've provided.\n\n2. **Unscrewing the Oil Filter Gauge Cap Assembly**: The video would demonstrate how to unscrew the cap safely.\n\n3. **Checking the Oil Level**: After the cap is removed, the video would show how to check the current oil level by dipping the cap back into the engine without threading it.\n\n4. **Draining Old Oil**: Following the oil level check, the next step would likely demonstrate locating the oil drain plug and unscrewing it to allow the oil to drain into an oil pan.\n\n5. **Reinstalling the Drain Plug**: Once the oil has been drained, the video would show how to replace the oil drain plug and tighten it to the specified torque.\n\n6. **Adding New Oil**: The video would conclude the task by showing how to refill the engine with the new 10W-30 oil, with measurements of 19.5 fluid ounces or 577 milliliters.\n\n7. **Final Oil Level Check**: After refilling, a last check of the oil level would be performed to ensure the refill was done accurately.\n\n8. **Clean-up and Recap**: Finally, there would be a wrap-up, with instructions on how to properly dispose of the old oil and a recap of the importance of the maintenance schedule.\n\nPlease note that while these steps are based on the provided guidelines, the actual sequence and visuals of the steps would depend on the content of the video that these images are extracted from."
