Welcome back to our AIE tutorial series to help you get to know your Honda GX160. Today we're going to be checking and changing the oil on our Honda GX160 UT2 QX2 with genuine Honda engine oil using 08207-10W30. Please check the oil before every use. You'll want to change the oil after the first month or 20 hours of use and after that every six months or 100 hours. Before changing your oil make sure the engine is fully cooled down and you have your 10mm 6-point socket and ratchet handy as well as an oil pan. First let's locate the gray oil filter gauge cap assembly. The location of the cap will vary based on the application of the engine. Unscrew the oil filter gauge cap assembly. Pull out the cap and wipe it cleanly. To check the oil level dip the cap back in. Do not thread the cap in any further. This will give you an accurate indication of current oil levels. The specification for the oil quantity is 0.61 quarts which should amount to about three quarters of the way up on the oil filter gauge. Now locate the oil drain plug located at the base of the block. The location may vary depending on the application of the engine. Take your ratchet and loosen the oil drain plug. Once the plug is loosened fully unscrew it by hand. Make sure that you have an oil pan to collect the used oil. Reinsert the drain plug washer and tighten it by hand. Then fully secure the plug by tightening with your ratchet to 13 foot-pounds of torque. Do not over tighten otherwise you will crack the block. Begin filling the engine with 19.5 fluid ounces or 577 milliliters of genuine Honda oil. Always check the oil one last time after refill to ensure the correct amount.
